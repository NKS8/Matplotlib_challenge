Observataion and Insights
1. There are 10 types of drugs studied. 
        a.Two of them such as Capomulin and Ceftamin are used the most number of mice during study. 
        b.Two of them such as Stelasyn and Zoniferol are used the least number of mice during study.
2. Final Tumor Volumes at the last Timepoints were extracted for 4 drugs from dataframe. 
        a. Capomulin and Ramicane are at the end of the timepoint had the least tumor volumes.
        a. Infubinol and Ceftamin are at the end of the timepoint had the higher tumor volumes .
           compare to  Capomulin and Ramicane.
3. Weight of the mouse and Tumor volume has positive strong corelations since rvalue >= 0.7. 
   Also, from scatter plot linear regression line fitting shows that slope is positive as weight 
   increases tumor volume increases as well.
